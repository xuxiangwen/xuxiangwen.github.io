## What's Python

**Python** is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Maybe, Python is the most popular language in machine learning. 

### Python vs. C#

| **C#**                                                       | **Python**                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Developed by Microsoft. Comes with the license.              | Open-source development and distribution, even for commercial use |
| Based on OOP concepts                                        | supports multi-paradigm programming (OOP, **procedural**)    |
| Statically typed. The compiler will give errors for wrong typecasting | Dynamic type-casting. No need for variable declarations.     |
| Supports work on .NET framework                              | Can be integrated with Java (JVM), .NET, C and JavaScript    |
| Dependency injection works like a charm.                     | No concept of DI as such, however, you can add customized tags to any object at run time or do [monkey patching](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5626193/what-is-monkey-patching) to point to a different third-party code for testing. |
| More organized and consistent syntax and format.             | Simple, easy to read and code, doesnâ€™t contain too many symbols or formats. |
| More **static** language. Everything has to be built (compiled) and then run. | Reduces a whole step in the development cycle as everything is **dynamic**, picked at run-time. |
| No interpreter                                               | Interactive interpreter to write programs easily             |
| Because of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) framework, C# is **faster** and offers better performance | The development work is faster, but when compared to C#, the performance is slightly lacking. |
| Library support is good and has its base from the .NET framework | There is no beating Python in its [huge set of pre-packaged libraries](https://hackr.io/blog/top-python-libraries). A lot of code can be reused which makes the work easy for developers |
| Multi-threading is quite easy using the .NET framework       | Because of the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**, multithreading requires multiple processes. |
