## What's Machine Learning

---

### [What's Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DEL6SVRPw0)

- [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) (1959): The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

- [Tom M. Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_M._Mitchell) (1998) : A computer program is said to learn from experience *E* with respect to some class of tasks *T* and performance measure *P* if its performance at tasks in *T*, as measured by *P*,  improves with experience *E*.

### Your First Machine Learning Course

[Machine Learning | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.

![Profile](images/AndrewNg-Headshot-16525924758666.jpg)

> Suggestion:  re-implement the codes with Python because the programming language in the course is MATLAB.

### Mathematics for Machine Learning

In order to understand the algorithms better, we should have some math knowledge. 

- [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
- [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
- [Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics)

Book: [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)

## Why is Python So Popular



![bg left:40% ](images/image-20210615163413684-16525924758668.png)

Python is the **most popular language** in the future.

| More organized and consistent syntax and format.       | **Simple, easy to read and code**, doesnâ€™t contain too many  symbols or formats. |
| Faster and offers better performance                   | Compared to C#, the  performance is **slightly lacking.**    |
| Multi-threading is quite easy using the .NET framework | Because of Global Interpreter Lock, multithreading **requires  multiple processes.** |

### [What Is Deep Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M5VXKLf4D4)

- a subset of machine learning

- `Deep` : refers to the use of multiple **neural layers** in the network

- always use GPU to train models.
- more data,  better model

## Samples of Deep Learning

it's a great way to study deep learning through samples.
