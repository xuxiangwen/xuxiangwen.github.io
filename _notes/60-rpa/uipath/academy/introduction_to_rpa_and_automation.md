## [What Is RPA? What Is Automation?](https://academy.uipath.com/learningpath-viewer/5636/1/199653/2)

- **RPA:**
  - is the technology that allows computer software to mimic actions typically performed by humans.
  - is non-invasive and scalable.
  - can work in any industry, especially when combined with AI.
  - reduces costs rapidly and increases ROI.
  - can automate highly manual, repetitive and rule-based processes, with low exception rates and a standard electronic readable input.
- **A robot** is the computer software that executes automations. They are as accurate as the instructions people create for them.
- **Digital transformation** refers to technology, as well as people. Employee upskilling is key when it comes to a successful transformation.
- **Can anyone build an automation?** Short answer: **yes**. Stick around and discover how you could do it, too!

## [**Automation Is Driving the Digital Transformation**](https://academy.uipath.com/learningpath-viewer/5636/1/199653/2)

Digital transformation can be anything from IT infrastructure modernization to optimization or new digital business models. 

- **Is RPA the only technology available for Business Process** **Automation****?**
  No. Today, multiple technologies revolve around RPA to enhance automation results.
- RPA alone can process solely structured digital documents. Together with **AI** and **ML** models, it can process, for example, scanned invoices—which are unstructured, digitally converted documents. 
- RPA interacts with an application through the User Interface. With **Native Integrations**, automation development is much simpler for commonly used applications like SAP or Salesforce.

- **Advanced analytics** help you measure automation performance against business KPIs (like time or money saved).

- **Long-running workflows** enable you to orchestrate complex automated processes. It facilitates synchronous and asynchronous interactions between human users and robots for maximum effectiveness and resource allocation.

- **Process Mining** **and Task Mining** allow you to scientifically discover automation use cases in the organization by analyzing back-end and front-end data.

- **Automation is industry agnostic** - no matter how you look at it, there are automation use-cases in any business.
- **Automation doesn't just impact revenue and time** - automating repetitive tasks also leads to an improved customer and employee experience, eases the AI operations, ensures compliance, and makes the decision-making process faster.
