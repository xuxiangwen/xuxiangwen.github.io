<div align="center" style="font-size:36px;">My Favorite Festival</div>

My Favorite Festival is Spring Festival. It goes from New Year's Eve to the seventh day of the first lunar month. Its origin is to drive away the terrible beasts. Children wear new clothes and set off firecracker. Adults  hang lanterns and post couplets. All the members of the family gather to enjoy a reunion dinner. I like to eat dumplings, rice cakes, and sweet dumplings. At night, we watch the Spring Festival Gala until 1 am in the morning . Is the Spring Festival very interesting? So which festival do you like best?
